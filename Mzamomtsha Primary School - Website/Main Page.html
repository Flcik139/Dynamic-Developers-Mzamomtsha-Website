    <p style="font-size: large;">Mzamomtsha Primary School is located between Khayelistha Township and uMfuleni Township in the Western Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa.
        The school's headmaster, Mr. Simphiwe Khuze, joined in 2007. The school is located in a semi-township called Drift Sands which started off as an informal settlement.
        Drift Sands has since been developed and with support from the South African government it turned into a sprawling township with state of the art housing units.
        Mzamomtsha Primary School is plays a key role in Drift Sands and is supporting the local community.</p>

    <!--This paragraph is under the images of the learners.-->
    <p style="font-size: large;">The school was initially created for primary school students from Grade 1 to Grade 7, but due to the rapid
    population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades. Students are allowed up
    to Grade 12 - which is the Matric year. Mzamomtsha School in the remote township of Driftsands has a severe
    shortage of classrooms and chairs. This follows an early 2018 instruction from the district office for the
    school to accommodate children who could not fit into overcrowded Mfuleni schools. The Department of Education
    promised the school mobile classes to help handle the increased learner population, but these have still had
    not been delivered. Parents organised a protest to highlight the school’s needs, but nothing has changed.
    Frustrations are growing, and parents are even contemplating closing down the school permanently as they feel
    the learning conditions their children are enduring are unacceptable.</p>
